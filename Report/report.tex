\title{\bf HULK Interpreter documentation}
\author{Eduardo Brito Labrada}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In computer science, an {\bf interpreter} is a computer program that directly executes
  intructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously
  to have been compiled into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the
  following strategies for program execution:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Parse the source code and perform behavior directly;
    \item Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation or object code
          and inmediately execute that;
    \item Explicitly execute stored precompiled bytecode made by a compiler and matched with the
          interpreter Virtual Machine.
  \end{enumerate}

  In this project we will focus on the first strategies of those to create a interpreter for
    {\em Havana University Language for Kompilers (HULK)}. First we will define the basic syntax of the
  language and then we will show how the interpreter works in its entirety.

\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\bf Introduction}

HULK is a didactic, type-safe, object-oriented and incremental programming language. This is a simplified
version of HULK where we will be implementing a subset of this programming language. In particular, this
subset consists only of expressions that can be written on one line.

\subsection*{Expressions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Expressions}

HULK is a ultimately an expression-based language. Most of the syntactic constructions in HULK are expressions,
including the body of all functions, loops and other block of code.

The body of a program in HULK always end with a single global expression (and, if necessary, a final semicolon\footnote{In this
  version of HULK all expressions end with a single semicolon}) that serves as the entrypoint of the program.

\subsubsection*{Arithmetic expressions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Arithmetic expressions}

HULK defines three types of literal values: {\bf numbers}, {\bf strings} and {\bf booleans}. Numbers are $32$-bit floating-point
and support all basic arithmetic operations with the usual semantic: {\tt +} (addition), {\tt -} (subtraction), {\tt *} (multiplication),
{\tt \slash} (floating-point division), {\tt \^{}} (power), and parenthesized sub-expressions.

\subsubsection*{Strings}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Strings}

Strings literals in HULK are defined within enclosed double-quotes ({\tt "}). A double-quote
can be included literally by escaping it ($\backslash${\tt "}), and other escaped characters
are $\backslash${\tt n} for line endings and $\backslash${\tt t} for tabs. Also, strings can
be concatenated with other strings (or the string representation of numbers) using the {\tt @}
operator.
